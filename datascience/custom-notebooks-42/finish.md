In this workshop you learnt how you can build a custom container image which incorporates a set of Jupyter notebooks and the packages they require, and deploy the image to OpenShift.

Further details on the example Jupyter notebook images and templates used in this workshop can be found at:

This Git repository is part of the [Jupyter on OpenShift](https://github.com/jupyter-on-openshift) project, a community project for demonstrating how Jupyter notebooks and JupyterHub can be deployed to OpenShift.

Check out the other workshops here for details of how to create your own custom notebook images, create a persistent workspace for working with Jupyter notebooks, how to deploy Jupyter Project community images, and how to deliver Jupyter notebooks to multiple users at the same time using JupyterHub.
